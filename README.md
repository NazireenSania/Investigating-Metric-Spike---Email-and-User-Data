## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

The project uses 3 core tables:

| Table Name     | Description                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `users`        | User metadata including signup and activation timestamps         |
| `events`       | User activity logs (e.g., login, message, search)                |
| `email_events` | Email-related actions (e.g., sent, opened, clickthrough)         |

All timestamp columns were converted from `VARCHAR` to `DATETIME` using `STR_TO_DATE()` for accurate temporal analysis.
